# SimpleCNN-vs-ResNet

## Description
A school project for my deep learning class where a simple CNN is compared to a ResNet50 model, using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to evaluate the performance of each model on the same image classification task, and observe how ResNet50 is utilized to reduce potential issues such as the vanishing gradient problem in deep convolutional neural networks, as well as having more efficient training due to using pre-trained weights. 

## Features
- Two .ipynb files, one for each model, originally run in Google Colab. 
- Train and evaluate a simple CNN and a ResNet50 model.
- Compute accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F-1 score for each model and compare.
- Results are plotted in the respective notebook for each model. 

## Dataset
- [CIFAR-10 dataset on Kaggle](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class.

## Results
- Simple CNN Test Accuracy:
- ResNet50 Test Accuracy:

## Instructions to run the Notebooks
- Upload .ipynb files to Google Drive, open in Google Colab
- No setup required, just run the cells!
- Or try using Jupyter
